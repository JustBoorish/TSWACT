*** How to install ***

Unpack the TSWACT directory into \Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\ located in the root of your Secret World Legends directory, so it looks like this:

\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\TSWACT\TSWACT.swf
\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\TSWACT\CharPrefs.xml
\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\TSWACT\Modules.xml

REMEMBER: Go into Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) Options and Enable the TSWACT addon in the Secret Parsing section.
PLEASE NOTE: Make sure you restart your client after installing this add-on. Always restart your client when adding XML files as these only get read on load.
ALSO NOTE: You need Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) installed and the ACT TSW plugin version 1.0.4.0 or greater for this addon to work
